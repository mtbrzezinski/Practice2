    1 - How can you make the element uniques with collection? (American style)
    In my project I was using set to make the items unique to prevent duplication
    which causes some problems for my project
    2 - What is set? What is the purpose of using it? (Indian style)
    It is a way to stire the unique elements
    3 - Can you tell me the types of collections?
    Set
    List
    Queue
    4 - Can you explain the difference between them(Set and List)?
    Set:
    only unique elements
    !It doesn't have indexing, so you can access the element by iterating for each loop!!
    Synthax is different - Set numbers = new HashSet();

    List:
    it can store duplicate elements as well
    It has indexing, so you can access the element by iterating for and foreach loop
    List numbers = new ArrayList();

    5 - What is the difference between Set Types?
    HashSet() - it stores the element without any orders
    LinkHashSet() - it stores the element insertion(the order that you put)
    TreeSet() -is stores the element with ascending(sort) orders. NO NULL

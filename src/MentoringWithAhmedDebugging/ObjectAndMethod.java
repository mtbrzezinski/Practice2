    Possible interview question:
    FACEBOOK:
    1)what is object? tell me about its methods?
    **Object is a presentation of the class (blueprint)
    **There ate many methods of object but we focus on this:
    ---> .equals - comparison
    ---> .toString -  it shows all the variables
    ---> .Hashcode - location of the element(object)

    2) What is the difference between object and class?
    Object and Class:
    Class: is a blueprint/ template which you can create as many objects as you want
    Object: a member or instance of a class
    Object: you can create object as many as you want
    Class:  one class I can have for this scenario
    Object: is declared with NEW keyword
    Class: is declared with CLASS keyword
    Object: is the all parents of the class (OBJECT AS A CLASS)

    3) How do you initialize the instance variables?
    *There are different ways to initialize the instance variables.
    used:
    CONSTRUCTOR
    Methods(Setters)
    Create an object
    Directly assign the value for instance variables

    4) What is the difference between Instance and Local Variables:
    Instance variables belong to blocks
    Local variables belong to method
    Instance variables as default null, 0, 0.0 if they are initialized
    Local variables don't have default values, it wil give you compile time errir
    Instance variables can have access modifiers, static, final
    Local variables cannot have any of these ket words

    1 - What is garbage collector and where is it coming from?
    Is a way of cleaning unused or useless data from heap memory
    it is coming from System

    2 - How can you prove that garbage collector is working
    We can override the finalize method to prove that gc is working

    3 - How can you make the element garbage?
    By assigning the "null" values

    4 - Can you call gc() many times?
    You can only call gc() one time and it doesn't mean it is going to work 100%

     5 - Do you have to call gc to clean up your codes?
     No, because it works all the time automatically

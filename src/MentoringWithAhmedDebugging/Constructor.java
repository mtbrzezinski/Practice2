    /*
    What is constructor and what do you do with it?
    Constructor is a way to initialize the instance variables
    Assign the values into the object

    2)Can you tell me the difference between constructor and method
    Constructor: doesn't have return type
    Methods: does have return type
    Constructor: Must have same name of the class
    Methods: may or may not have same name of the class

    3) Can you make the constructor static, private or final?
    You cannot make the constructor static, or final, BUT you can make the constructor private in
    SOME SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
    ---> In Automation we have a SINGLETON PATTERN DESIGN CLASS for my driver
    so at this time, I make my constructor private to make sure it is
    NOT initialized outside the class.

    4) What  is the difference between this, this(), super, super()?
    this keyword in java - this refers to instance variables, methods
    this() in java - this() refers to constructor from same class - !must be first line
    super in java - refers to parent instance variables also methods
    super() in java - refers to constructor from parent class
